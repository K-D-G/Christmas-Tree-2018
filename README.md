# Christmas-Tree-2018
A small Christmas tree project with an Arduino and lights

To use this code you will only need one dependency and that is the FastLED library (https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED or http://fastled.io/)

The Arduino used by me is the arduino uno
My use is shown here on my website: https://K-D-G.github.io/projects/c++/christmas_tree_2018.html
